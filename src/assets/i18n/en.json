Only one person is allowed to explain each term. The order does not matter as long as every team has had the chance to explain the same number of cards at the end. No technical terms should be used. All words appearing on the card are initially forbidden, as are words deriving from them in the form of other nouns, verbs or adjectives. If, for example, water appears on the card, water, watery and watering would be forbidden. As soon as the words or derivatives are said by any player on the guessing teams, they can also be used by the explaining player. Using any words on the card or their derivatives before they are mentioned by the guessing players is considered an error, the card must be set aside and will not be counted. This is also the case if rhymes or word similarities ( „sounds like“) and imitating noises are used. The use of formulas, equations or symbols is also not allowed. Players may use their hands (and bodies) when explaining terms, except to form letters and symbols.",
